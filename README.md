# CODSOFT MACHINE LEARNING INTERNSHIP
For the machine learning internship, I have to complete at least 3 tasks for successful completion of the internship.

Therefore, I did the following ML projects :
* Task 1: Credit Card Detection using Random Forest Model.
* Task 2: Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Random Forest Model.
* Task 3: Spam SMS Detection using Naive Bayes model and pipelining it.
